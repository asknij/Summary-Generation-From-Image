#Abstract

A summary is a small condensed text ,itâ€™s purpose is to summarize a text's ideas and concepts without any modification or interpretation. Because the summary delivers a clear structure, the text is easy to digest. Summaries are also capable of making a smooth transition from general to specific, uncovering the main ideas of the text in more detail. In case of a heavy text, the resulting summary has a good overall readability without additional information noise, dangling references, broken-up sentences, or semantic flaws. Thus there is a need for a summary generation system. The basic working of the system is processing of input text content from user and producing its corresponding summary as output. The input content can be in the form of text, photo, etc. The summarized content can be given out in the form of text or vocal. The processing is done using natural language processing and this tool analyzes the textual patterns of any piece to render the best results. The process is very similar to extracting key phrases, where the purpose is to find phrases or individual words that could be used as tags for the text or document. It identifies the keywords in the text and count each word's relevance, extracts sentences from the text given, identifies the sentences with most relevant keywords and output them as a meaningful set of sentences constituting the summary. A summary generation system can deliver instant results. It can increase our productivity. It can become a vital part of our review sessions. It can still be a huge help when we have to review material to prepare for a test or exam.
